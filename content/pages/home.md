## About Me
I have recently graduated from Bournemouth University with a first in BA (Hons) Computer Animation Technical Arts.
In my studies I have primarily focused on procedural systems and physics simulations, both through the use of existing tools and also directly through code.

Throughout my studies I have had the opportunity to explore a wide range of skills and tools, while also being able to focus on the areas that interest me. In addition to the various software packages and programming languages I have learned, I have also been able to develop my artistic capabilities and problem solving skills.
