[RowanCH.com](https://www.rowanch.com) - (Note, the old site is currently still live, this one will replace it in the coming days as I configure the server and the dns updates) site source code is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later

Pages contents, excluding externally embedded or linked content is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 Unless Otherwise Specified.

The site is built using pelican and tailwindcss

A nix flake is provided for easy development.
Unfortunately, currently the tailwindcss plugins are not managed through nix and as such should be installed with npm from within the development environment.

The theme (/themes/rowanch) is based on the pelican "simple" template
